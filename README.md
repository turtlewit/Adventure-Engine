#Adventure Engine 2

##In C this time.

Welcome to my second attempt at a text adventure language!  
My previous attempt, Adventure Engine, was written in Python,
and is wrought with bad design and naivete. This time, I'm back
with C. Mainly I'm just interested in learning the C paradigm,
and how it differs from the object oriented paradigm that I'm
used to.
